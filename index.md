I am a Izaak Killam and NSERC Postdoctoral fellow, working in the [Otto lab](http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/~otto/) at the [University of British Columbia's Biodiversity Research Centre](http://www.biodiversity.ubc.ca). I use computational approaches to understand large-scale patterns of biodiversity and the evolutionary and ecological processes that generate them.
