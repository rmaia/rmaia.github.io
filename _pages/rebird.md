# reBird: a programmatic interface to the eBird API

I have been collaborating with the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) team developing an R package that uses the [eBird](http://ebird.org/content/ebird/) API to interface with its webservices. Package is available from CRAN, and the development version is available from [github](https://github.com/ropensci/rebird). You can also find a tutorial for the package [here](https://ropensci.org/tutorials/rebird_tutorial.html).
